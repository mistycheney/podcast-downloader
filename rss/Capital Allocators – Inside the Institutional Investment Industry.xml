			<description><![CDATA[<p class="m_-7366852525004397164MsoNoSpacing">Ed Grefenstette is the CIO of The Dietrich Foundation, which supports charitable organizations in Western Pennsylvania through a truly unique investment strategy that seeks to first, last, and always grow the assets. Bill Dietrich, a successful industrialist, published historian, international investor, and innovative philanthropist, formed the foundation after selling his business for $170 million in 1997. Since then, the pool has grown 11.5x to $1.5 billion after distributing $400 million to supported charities, including contributions that make it among the largest donors every year to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Over the last twenty years, the Dietrich Foundation's performance sits at the very top of all endowments and foundations.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> </p> <p class="MsoNormal">Our conversation covers Ed's journey to investing and mentorship by Bill Dietrich, which led to him taking the helm at the Foundation in 2007. We discuss the Foundation's bold approach to illiquid investments, with 90% of assets invested in venture capital and private equity, its governance structure, and its thematic focus on innovation and emerging markets. Along the way, Ed shares insights into managing liquidity, constructing the portfolio, selecting managers, and navigating geopolitical risk to maintain conviction in an uncomfortably different strategy.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> </p> <p class="MsoNormal">Ed’s approach and results will open your aperture to what’s possible in an institutional portfolio with the right goals, structure, and governance in place.</p> <p class="m_-7366852525004397164elementtoproof"> </p> <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Follow Ted on Twitter at <u><a title= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/tseides?lang%3Den&source=gmail&ust=1742653687479000&usg=AOvVaw2rSfPNzQJbBNx_OdFC_5Vb">@tseides</a></u> or <u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/&source=gmail&ust=1742653687480000&usg=AOvVaw1EjtDJl7oWFelrhpkydaxU">LinkedIn</a></u><br />  Subscribe to the <u><a title="https://capitalallocators.com/" href="https://capitalallocators.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/&source=gmail&ust=1742653687480000&usg=AOvVaw0sArFIhFabG9p11KdXbA8Y">mailing list</a></u><br /> Access Transcript with <u><a title= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup" href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/signup&source=gmail&ust=1742653687480000&usg=AOvVaw2OvCgtqpBxPSA5rd-z8bZf">Premium Membership</a></u></p>]]></description>

Lime Rock Capital created CrownRock alongside a management team with $96.5 million of cash and assets in 2007. Seventeen years later, sold the business to Occidental Petroleum for $12.5 billion.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Lime Rock’s original investment made 79x its money, a net IRR of 18%, and $7.5 billion in gains, which ranks in the top ten fully exited private equity deals of all time.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Eric Peters leads both One River Asset Management and Coinbase Asset Management and writes a widely dispersed blog called Wknd Notes, in which he shares macro insights. He’s twice been a guest on the show, discussing his bespoke macro investment strategy four years ago and the case for Bitcoin three years ago.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Brad Briner is the leading candidate for the Treasurer of North Carolina in the upcoming November election, a role that includes managing the state’s $115 billion pension fund. Brad put himself in the ring for the seat after twenty-five years of investment experience, serving most recently as Co-CIO of Willett Advisors, Michael Bloomberg’s family office.

He’s also my co-founder and partner of Capital Allocators Summits and Capital Allocators University, and is one of the most beloved and respected investor relations professionals in the industry.<br /> <br /> I asked Rahul to come back on the show to update his thoughts on what it takes to succeed in a far more difficult capital-raising environment, what he’s learned over the last five years, how he shares his wisdom to make the industry better through our partnership, and the world at large better through his extensive charitable work.<br /> <br /> Our newest creation – Capital Allocators University for IR/BD professionals – was Rahul and my partner Hank’s shared creation.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s show is the second in an ongoing mini-series discussing Training Grounds, organizations that have developed industry leaders. The first episode discussed Carnegie Corporation, where over a dozen years 8 of the 17 investment professionals that came through the doors became CIOs at Carnegie or other institutions.</p> <p><br /> Bain Capital is one of the world’s largest private alternative investment firms.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">3G Capital’s buyout of Burger King may be the most successful private equity deal you’ve never heard about. Over the last fourteen years, or the length of a typical private equity fund, 3G turned a $1 billion investment into $28 billion in value. The annual dividends from the investment accruing to 3G today are around 70% of its invested capital. The deal is one of the highest earning buyouts ever.<br /> <br /> 3G is an organization with a storied history. Founded by Jorge Paolo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira, and Marcel Herrmann Telles, the group created an owner-operator model of investing. They rose to prominence through building the largest beer company in the world, initially buying local brewer Brahma in 1989, expanding it and merging with a competitor to become AmBev in 1999, merging with Interbrew to become ImBev in 2004, and taking over Anheuser Busch in 2008 to become AB InBev.<br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Alex Behring, a young star on their team, moved to the US to form 3G Capital and take the approach abroad.<br /> Burger King was the second largest hamburger fast food chain after McDonalds in 2010 when 3G took it private. What it accomplished since then has been extraordinary.<br /> <br /> My guests to discuss 3G and the deal are Alex Behring and Daniel Schwartz. Co-Managing Partners of 3G Capital.<br /> <br /> Our conversation covers the history of 3G, Alex's journey to form 3G Capital, and the 3G playbook. We then dive into the deal, covering the sourcing and deal dynamics, improving operations, growing the business, taking the company public unexpectedly, and reloading to buy Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s, and Firehouse Subs. Today’s Burger King is part of Restaurant Brands International (QSR), a public company with a $32 billion market cap and $50 billion enterprise value.<br /> <br /> This classic deal will widen your aperture on what’s possible with a long-term, compounding holding period and operational excellence.</p> <p><strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/tseides?lang%3Den&source=gmail&ust=1714598424466000&usg=AOvVaw2ne8XHiQiixtU81F9QAk7g">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/&source=gmail&ust=1714598424466000&usg=AOvVaw2Sq2gvW9FnGfvsbYFWv5En">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href="https://capitalallocators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/&source=gmail&ust=1714598424466000&usg=AOvVaw05HFvxBsFnhGkNAJyeamt1">mailing list</a><br /> Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/signup&source=gmail&ust=1714598424467000&usg=AOvVaw3h940Dhh5rc4HwRYIWn2zK">Premium Membership</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s show is the first in an ongoing mini-series discussing Training Grounds, organizations that have developed and spawned future industry leaders. We’ll cover both allocators and managers to see what we can learn about developing talent.</p> <p>In the first episode of the mini-series, we discuss Carnegie Corporation of New York. Ellen Shuman became Carnegie’s first CIO in 1999 after working for David Swensen at Yale. Over her dozen year tenure and that of Meredith Jenkins and Kim Lew for the next dozen, and incredible 8 of the 17 investment professionals that walked in the door have become CIOs, and the rest appear either on their way or found their passion as leaders in complimentary roles or outside the industry. Those who became sitting CIOs are Meredith at Carnegie and Trinity Wall Street, Kim at Carnegie and Columbia, Jon Michael Consalvo at Carnegie, Alisa Mall at Michael Dell’s Family Office, Niles Bryant at Bowdoin College, Brooke Jones at Bryn Mawr College, Ken Lee at Children’s Healthcare, and Li Tan at Radian X.  Carnegie is a lesser-known allocator training ground than Yale, but it’s produced half the number of future CIOs from fraction of the team size.</p> <p>My guests to discuss how this happened are Ellen Shuman, Meredith Jenkins, Kim Lew, and Alisa Mall. We cover the chronology of their paths, and the Carnegie organization and investment process, including recruiting, culture, research, decision-making, and succession. Alongside the many applicable lessons they share, their palpable love and respect for each other is evident from the get go.</p> <p><strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/tseides?lang%3Den&source=gmail&ust=1711636673986000&usg=AOvVaw2vByDgBR_ZdA6YVAloaJZk">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/&source=gmail&ust=1711636673986000&usg=AOvVaw2ae4yjQByK5GrwlL0ybLkb">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href="https://capitalallocators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/&source=gmail&ust=1711636673986000&usg=AOvVaw2Bwmwapd3c7NpP9drHwmlY">mailing list</a><br /> Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/signup&source=gmail&ust=1711636673986000&usg=AOvVaw1KHiXM7Lm-_gRdodpEkQzf">Premium Membership</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Next week, we’ll release the first episode of Season 3 of Private Equity Deals, this time focusing on deals in the middle market.<br /> <br /> <br /> As an interlude between Season 2 and 3, this week’s show is a classic – it’s Bain Capital and KKR’s take private of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) in 2006.  The $33 billion club deal was the largest private equity transaction in history at the time and was significantly larger than any deal since KKR’s famous run at RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. The HCA deal showed the private equity industry the scale of what was possible and set the stage for both mega buyouts and public to private deals ever since.<br /> <br /> <br /> My guest is Chris Gordon, a Partner and Co-Head of Private Equity in North America for Bain Capital. Bain Capital today is one of the world’s largest private, multi-asset investing firms that oversees over $165 billion in assets. Seventeen years ago, Chris was a younger member of Bain Capital’s HCA deal team.<br /> <br /> HCA is one of the nation’s leading healthcare services providers, with over 182 hospitals and 2,300 sites of care in 20 states and the United Kingdom. Its origins date back to 1968 when it was one of the first hospital companies in the United States.<br /> <br /> <br /> Our conversation covers HCA’s history, the private equity environment in the mid-2000s, and the impetus for the HCA buyout. We discuss the complexity of navigating a large-scale transaction, conducting due diligence discretely, navigating the financial crisis, and what happened to the company. We turn to HCA’s return to the public markets through an IPO in 2011, Bain Capital’s eventual exit of the investment, and the implications of the deal on the firm and industry.<br /> <br /> <br /> For full show notes, visit the episode webpage <a href= "https://www.capitalallocators.com/podcast/classic-deal-hca/">here</a>.<br />  <br /> <br /> Learn More<br /> Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a><br /> Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s show is a panel about the merits of private equity. On one side is Sachin Khajuria. a former partner at Apollo and twenty-five-year veteran of the industry, who recently authored “Two and Twenty.” Sachin was a past guest on the show discussing his book and that conversation is replayed in the feed.<br /> On the other is Brendan Ballou, a federal prosecutor who serves on the special counsel for private equity in the Justice Department’s antitrust division and recently authored “Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America,” highlighting controversy and potential flaws in private market investing.<br /> Our conversation begins with Sachin’s view on private markets as an essential value-additive element of the economy and Brendan’s thesis on the inadequacy of the legal structure surrounding the activity. We discuss incentives, investment duration, failed deals, fees, operational effectiveness, legal environment, risk, and broad education about the space. While the titles of their books might suggest a point-counterpoint discussion, the thoughtful nuance Sachin and Brendan bring to the table offer more commonality and food for thought than difference.<br /> <br /> For full show notes, visit the episode webpage <a href= "https://www.capitalallocators.com/podcast/private-equity-profit-or-plunder/"> here</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn More<br /> Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a><br /> Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>James Aitken is the Founder of Aitken Advisors, a one-man macroeconomic consultancy based in Wimbledon, England that works with one hundred of the most influential pools of capital in the world. James has been a repeat guest on the show. Our very first conversation five years ago including his background and process, and the most recent one last year are replayed in the feed.

Regulations prevent us from disclosing investment returns almost all the time on the show, but Porter and Vinnie manage only their own money today and are an exception to that rule.

We close discussing Marc’s involvement in politics and lessons from chess and poker. </p> <p class="MsoNormal">For full show notes, visit the episode webpage <a href= "https://www.capitalallocators.com/podcast/avenues-of-opportunity/"> here</a>.</p>  <p>Learn More​</p>   <p>Follow Ted on Twitter at <a title= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a>​</p>   <p>Subscribe to the <a title="https://capitalallocators.com/" href="https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a>​</p>   <p>Access Transcript with <a title= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup" href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a>​</p> ]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Beezer Clarkson, Chris Douvos, and Joelle Kayden are three of the most respected investors in venture capital funds, manning their forts at Sapphire Ventures, Ahoy Capital, and Accolade Partners, respectively.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The name Anthony Scaramucci currently has 55% name recognition in the U.S. according to Politico. Anthony has been an entrepreneur in the hedge fund industry for 23 years, growing to prominence within the industry through his oversight of fund of funds Skybridge Capital, creation of the popular SALT conference, regular television appearances, and rejuvenation of the iconic television show Wall Street Week.  He grew to prominence worldwide when his longtime political interests led to a brief tenure as White House Communications Director in 2017.</p> <p>Our conversation starts off with a bang and turns to the ups and downs in Anthony’s career, including getting fired and rehired at Goldman Sachs, starting and selling his first hedge fund, creating Skybridge and watching it almost fail, and thriving after the financial crisis. We discuss Anthony's thoughts on hedge funds, lessons from his stint in Washington, and books he has written about his experiences. Along the way, he shares life lessons about managing people, building relationships, resiliency, laughing at yourself, greed, ego, and fame.</p> <p>Anyone who has only known Anthony from his recent public profile might be surprised to hear the depth of his insight, self-effacing honesty and caring of others, alongside his irrepressible salesmanship.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">The final episode of Season One of Private Equity Deals released this morning. I’m joined by Ravi Sachdev and Ron Williams from CD&R. Ravi is a specialist dealmaker in the healthcare space and Ron is an Operating Partner who is the former CEO of Aetna. We discuss agilon health, a company they created out of a concept to build a win-win for health care providers, payers, and Medicare patients. It contains aspects of a venture concept, buyout, and growth equity investing all wrapped into one.<br /> <br /> We’ve heard from some listeners that you can’t hear more than this minute of the Private Equity Deals episodes on this feed, and that’s correct.  We’ve experimented with releasing PE Deals on a completely separate podcast feed, so you’ll have to search and subscribe separately to listen to all of Season One.  Our apologies for any confusion and stay turned as we decide where we’ll release Season Two next year.<br /> <br /> <strong>Subscribe to Private Equity Deals<br /> <br /></strong>Subscribe on <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/private-equity-deals-with-capital-allocators/id1639927777"> Apple Podcast</a><br /> Subscribe on <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/0sebfAmGcpda8OsQidlu3L">Spotify</a><br />  Subscribe on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzQ_YWf9RsBP9ATbmv5kxQ">YouTube</a></span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Learn More</strong> </p> <p>Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a> </p> <p>Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a> </p> <p>Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a> </p>]]></description>

We also touch on Charley’s latest book, the 8th edition of his seminal classic.   Learn More  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a>  Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a>  Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">Matt Brown is the CEO of CAIS, the leading investment platform that connects independent financial advisors with managers in alternative strategies.  Matt was a guest on the show last year discussing his path and the business, and that conversation is replayed in the feed. Since that time, CAIS and the broader movement of private wealth into alternatives have accelerated rapidly.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Brown is the CEO of CAIS, the leading investment platform that connects independent financial advisors with managers in alternative strategies.  Matt was a guest on the show last year discussing his path and the business, and that conversation is replayed in the feed.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">Matt Brown is the Founder CEO of CAIS, a leading alternative investment platform on which thousands of financial advisors have invested over $12 billion in alternatives across private equity, private credit, hedge funds, and real estate.  Our conversation covers Matt’s background as both a financial advisor and distributor of alternatives that collectively led to the idea behind CAIS. We discuss the development of a two-sided platform, structural features for both financial advisors and managers, and challenges along the way. We then turn to the wave of capital coming from this community and what it means for investors.

She is the author of three books about navigating careers and leadership, <em>Expect to Win</em>, <em>Strategize to Win</em>, and the upcoming <em>Lead to Win</em>, each of which contains lessons she dubs “Carla’s Pearls.”<br /> <br /> In the last few years, Carla added Board seats to her professional portfolio and currently serves on a host of Boards including SEO, Harvard University, Walmart, and MetLife.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">Paul Enright is a private investor managing his own capital under single family office, Krainos Capital. Paul opened Krainos after a dozen years at Viking Global Investors, the multi-billion dollar long-short equity hedge fund that also has been one of the most successful breeding grounds for talent in the industry. He has a deep understanding of intricacies of long-short equity investing and a knack for explaining it well.<br /> <br /> Our conversation covers Paul’s career path to Viking, training while there, and advice to early-career investors. We dive into the distinction between business analysis and stock picking, and the importance of portfolio management to investment success. In the process, we discuss liquidity, shorting, portfolio rebalancing, incentive compensation, and market structure. We close with Paul’s approach to managing his own money and his answers to a terrific set of questions sourced from his Twitter feed before the show.</span></p> <div><strong>Learn More</strong> </div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Enright is a private investor managing his own capital under single family office, Krainos Capital. Paul opened Krainos after a dozen years at Viking Global Investors, the multi-billion dollar long-short equity hedge fund that also has been one of the most successful breeding grounds for talent in the industry. He has a deep understanding of intricacies of long-short equity investing and a knack for explaining it well.  Our conversation covers Paul’s career path to Viking, training while there, and advice to early-career investors. We dive into the distinction between business analysis and stock picking, and the importance of portfolio management to investment success. In the process, we discuss liquidity, shorting, portfolio rebalancing, incentive compensation, and market structure. We close with Paul’s approach to managing his own money and his answers to a terrific set of questions sourced from his Twitter feed before the show.</p> Learn More  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a>  Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a>  Access Transcript with <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/signup">Premium Membership</a>   Show Notes  <p class="Paragraph SCXW117115494 BCX0">(3:11) Paul’s background (8:11) Training at Viking (10:02) Stock picking (12:18) Business analysis (19:54) Liquidity’s impact on valuation (24:03) Dynamic portfolio management (28:46) Rebalancing (32:03) Long/Short Dynamics (40:50) Compensation structures (43:11) Current market structure (50:29) Investment model as a family office (53:05) Thoughts on Twitter  (57:07) Growing skills as a young PM (58:57) Advice to PMs in tough times (1:01:48) Best questions to ask managers (1:03:11) Closing questions </p>  ]]></content:encoded>

Brent is a media producer and operator whose first hit was <em>Pawn Stars</em> at his first production company, Leftfield Pictures. He later oversaw a host of reality television hits, including HGTV’s <em>Fixer Upper</em>, Netflix’s <em>Queer Eye</em>, A&E’s <em>Duck Dynasty</em>, and Bravo’s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey,</em> while running ITV America after he sold Leftfield to ITV.<br /> <br /> Our conversation covers Brent’s childhood entrepreneurial efforts, creation of <em>Pawn Stars</em>, vertically integrating and expanding Leftfield’s business, and the sale to ITV.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jordi Visser is the President & CIO of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, a $4 billion hedge fund focused on an innovative investment process, insightful data analytics, and cutting-edge thought leadership. Jordi came on the show and discussed his background and Weiss’ strategy back in 2019. That conversation is replayed on the feed. This time around we get a glimpse of Jordi’s thoughtfulness and rigor across work and life, including baseball cards for portfolio managers, the adaptability quotient or AQ, analytics for business development, and the great resignation in asset management. We then turn to Jordi’s market views on inflation and interest rates, blockchain and decentralization, health and longevity, and mental health and anxiety. We close with his passion for horseracing and its application to money management.<br /> <br /> <strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016">Apple</a> | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw==">Google</a> <br />  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/">mailing list</a><br /> Read the <a href= "https://capitalallocators.com/restricted-content">transcripts</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s episode of Manager Meetings, Ethan Berman interviews Hamish Corlett. Ethan was the founder and CEO of NYSE-listed RiskMetrics Group until it was bought by MSCI in 2010.

Hamish is a co-founder of TDM Growth Partners, an Australia-based investment firm that manages $1.5 billion in growth companies ranging from early-stage privates to publicly-listed companies on behalf of just 20 individuals. Before they get going, Ethan and I discuss how he met TDM, their research process from his perspective as a CEO of a public company, and his decision to invest personally.<br /> <br /> <strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016">Apple</a> | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw==">Google</a><br />  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe to the <a href= "file:///Users/mathewpassy/Library/Group%20Containers/2E337YPCZY.airmail/Library/Application%20Support/it.bloop.airmail2/Airmail/General/HtmlRender2/3B896256-A8A9-474D-AFD9-4DB35DF826AB/capitalallocators.com">mailing list</a><br /> Read the <a href= "file:///Users/mathewpassy/Library/Group%20Containers/2E337YPCZY.airmail/Library/Application%20Support/it.bloop.airmail2/Airmail/General/HtmlRender2/3B896256-A8A9-474D-AFD9-4DB35DF826AB/capitalallocators.com/signup">transcripts</a></p>]]></description>

Beezer is a past guest on Capital Allocators and is a Partner at Sapphire Ventures, where she is responsible for the management of Sapphire’s fund investments in early stage venture funds globally.<br /> <br /></div> <div>Mike and Nikhil are co-founders of Footwork Ventures, an early-stage venture firm that closed on its first fund earlier this year, which was significantly oversubscribed.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jenny Heller is the President and Chief Investment Officer of Brandywine Trust Group.  Brandywine formed 25 years ago to manage the capital for a small group of families that all share a long-term, multi-generational time horizon. Today, it oversees almost $9B for those same families, much of it from compounding over a quarter century. The Group invests flexibly across asset classes, with a focus on partnering with people who they believe have sustainable competitive advantages, share their long-term vision, and have highly aligned interests.  These elite managers often start with great ideas, but limited capital.</p> <p> Before taking the helm at Brandywine five years ago, Jenny worked at the Sloan Foundation, Stanford University Management Company, and Merrill Lynch in its investment banking program. She is a graduate of Williams College, where she serves on its Investment Advisory Committee, and Stanford Business School.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with Jenny’s frustrating experiences with a non-profit micro finance in India and South Africa and turns to her career allocating money on behalf of non-profits and families. We touch on subtleties in picking managers for taxable investors, challenges in executing a long-term strategy, learning from mistakes, and mentorship.

			<description><![CDATA[<div>My guests on today’s show are financial journalists Max Frumes and Sujeet Indap, co-authors of “The Caesars Palace Coup,” a book detailing the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment. Coming off the heels of our Private Equity Masters mini-series, this conversation dives into a private equity deal gone wrong, including some technical aspects of what it takes to emerge from a bankruptcy. We walk through the intricacies, tensions and dynamics of the Caesars bankruptcy, whose stakeholders included Apollo, TPG, GSO, Elliot, Silver Point, Oaktree, and Appaloosa – a literal who’s who of giants in private equity and distressed investing. We then turn to applicable lessons for investors, including power dynamics, the unwritten rules of distressed investing, and the role of skill and luck. <br /> <br /></div> <div><strong>Learn More</strong><br /> Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016">Apple</a> | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw==">Google</a><br />  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a><br />  Subscribe <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/signup">Monthly Mailing List</a><br /> Read the <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/subscriptionsignup/">Transcript</a></div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Charley Ellis is one of the most highly regarded experts in the investment business.  After spending nearly a decade as an equity research analyst in the 1960s, Charley founded financial services consulting firm Greenwich Associates in 1972 to help institutions understand what their clients think of them.  Over 50 years, Charley has worked hand in hand with nearly every major financial institution in the world and has published sixteen books on investing, including his most recent “The Index Revolution: Why Investors Should Join It Now.”</p> <p>Charley is not just another preacher for index fund investing. He extols the virtues of indexing after having looked both broadly and deeply under the covers of some of the most successful active managers in the world.</p> <p>Our conversation begins with a glimpse at what equity research and the structure of the markets looked like in the 1960s and the monumentally different way research is conducted and markets function today. Charley describes elegantly why indexing is a winner’s game for many, and then walks through very special and rare qualities of three of the most successful active managers over the last few decades – Vanguard, Capital Group, and Yale University.</p> <p>Charley is a brilliant communicator and masterful storyteller.

He also recently released a significant white paper on transparency and innovation for institutional investors for the Biden Administration.   Our conversation follows-up an early podcast, Episode 29, which is replayed in the feed.  This time around, we discuss the power of asset owners, issue of transparency, need for innovation and obstacles to achieving it, how and when to create change, examples of climate work at New Zealand Super, the Australian Super Funds, and Canadian Pension funds, and Ashby’s handful of technology start-ups focusing on these challenges.   Learn More Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016"> Apple</a> | <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU">Spotify</a> | <a href= "https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw=="> Google </a>  Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en">@tseides</a> or <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/signup"> Monthly Mailing List </a> Read the <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/subscriptionsignup/">Transcript </a>   ]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeff Housenbold, a Managing Director for the last four years at Softbank Investment Advisors, where he led one of the six investment teams that deployed the $100 billion Softbank Vision Fund. Prior to joining Softbank, Jeff worked at sixteen companies, including eleven years as CEO of Shutterfly. four years in the early days of ebay, four as Special Industry Advisor to KKR, and one as Entrepreneur in Residence at Sutter Hill Ventures. He’s also served on the Boards of dozens of companies, including Caesars Entertainment, Memphis Meats, DoorDash, Compass, Opendoor, Wag, and Groupon.   Our conversation starts with Jeff’s true rags to riches story, and then turns to a whirlwind of lessons learned as an operator at ebay during its hypergrowth and Shutterfly overseeing a successful turnaround. We then dive into the Softbank Vision Fund, including the original investment thesis, sourcing ideas, valuation discipline, decision making in groups, portfolio structure, and results.   We close by talking about the SPAC market, capital market expectations, the characteristics of successful organizations, and succession planning.   Please enjoy the countless nuggets of wisdom in my conversation with Jeff Housenbold.    Learn More  Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="7">Apple</a> | <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="10">Spotify</a> | <a href= "https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw==" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="13">Google </a>   Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="18">@tseides</a> or <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="21">LinkedIn</a>  Subscribe <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/signup" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="25">Monthly Mailing List </a>  Read the <a href="https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/subscriptionsignup/" data-slate-object="inline" data-key="29">Transcript </a> ]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jenny Heller is the President and Chief Investment Officer of Brandywine Trust Group.  Brandywine formed 25 years ago to manage the capital for a small group of families that all share a long-term, multi-generational time horizon. Today, it oversees almost $9B for those same families, much of it from compounding over a quarter century. The Group invests flexibly across asset classes, with a focus on partnering with people who they believe have sustainable competitive advantages, share their long-term vision, and have highly aligned interests.  These elite managers often start with great ideas, but limited capital.</p> <p> Before taking the helm at Brandywine five years ago, Jenny worked at the Sloan Foundation, Stanford University Management Company, and Merrill Lynch in its investment banking program. She is a graduate of Williams College, where she serves on its Investment Advisory Committee, and Stanford Business School.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with Jenny’s frustrating experiences with a non-profit micro finance in India and South Africa and turns to her career allocating money on behalf of non-profits and families. We touch on subtleties in picking managers for taxable investors, challenges in executing a long-term strategy, learning from mistakes, and mentorship.

We touched base about his perspective, but the situation is too fluid for a public response. Acting Chairman Behnam released brief statement about the silver markets that said, “The CFTC is closely monitoring recent activity in the silver markets. The Commission is communicating with fellow regulators, the exchanges, and stakeholders to address any potential threats to the integrity of the derivatives markets for silver, and remains vigilant in surveilling these markets for fraud and manipulation.” Stay tuned, as the subject may well be fodder for another conversation down the road.</p> <p><u><strong>Learn More</strong></u><br /> Subscribe: <a href= "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators/id1223764016"> <u>Apple</u></a> | <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/3q6PrjHVfRzpD2lN1g2XRU"><u>Spotify</u></a> | <a href= "https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3RlZHNlaWRlcy5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw=="> <u>Google </u></a> <br /> Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en"><u>@tseides</u></a> or <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/"><u>LinkedIn</u></a><br /> Subscribe <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/signup"> <u>Monthly Mailing List </u></a><br /> Read the <a href= "https://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/subscriptionsignup/"><u>Transcript </u></a><br />  <br /> <br /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Fran Kinniry is a twenty-three year veteran at the Vanguard Group, where he’s led the teams that spearhead Vanguard’s research into new products.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Marko Papic is the Chief Strategist at Clocktower Group, where he provides research on geopolitics, macroeconomics, and markets. Marko recently published Geopolitical Alpha: An Investment Framework for Predicting the Future, an imminently readable book with colorful examples of political analysis.

We touch on his thoughts about quantitative and qualitative investing and on internal and external fund management.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="auto">Gary Klein is a noted cognitive psychologist with an innate ability to see what others don’t. Over his 40-year career in the field, he’s pioneered the field of naturalistic decision making, the Pre-Mortem method of risk assessment, and the ShadowBox training approach. Gary is the author of five books and editor of three more, and most recently, founded Shadow Box, LLC in 2005 to train decision makers on his technique. You can learn all about Gary at <a href="http://gary-klein.com/" target="_blank" rel= "nofollow noopener noreferrer">gary-klein.com</a>.</p> <p dir="auto">Paul and Paul, you may recall, were guests on the show discussing their book that I greatly enjoyed, Pitch the Perfect Investment. Both are former investors and professors of finance.</p> <p dir="auto">Together Gary, Paul and Paul co-authored a paper entitled Rendering a Powerful Tool Flaccid: The Misuse of Premortems on Wall Street. The paper is a detailed look at how properly conduct Pre-Mortem analysis.</p> <p dir="auto">Our conversation covers Gary’s background studying expertise with fighter pilots, tools to improve decision-making, including the Shadow Box technique, Cognitive After-Action Reviews, and Pre-Mortems. We then do a deep dive on Pre-Aortem analysis, including its history in the Air Force, what it is, how it works, when it falls short, and the benefits of reducing overconfidence, time efficiency, increasing candor, making groups smarter. We discuss views on other risk mitigation techniques as well, including devil’s advocates, red teams, risk assessment, and critiques.</p> <p dir="auto">I found the conversation an incredible door opener to one of the most effective and time-efficient sources of value in improving investment decision-making processes.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Annie Duke is a renown public speaker and decision strategist. For two decades, she was one of the top poker players in the world, including winning a World Series of Poker bracelet and the $2 million winner-take-all WSOP Tournament of Champions. Her study of the science of smart decision-making began with a National Science Foundation Fellowship, which she used study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.  Among her charity work and television appearances, Annie was a runner-up to Joan Rivers on Celebrity Apprentice, during which she raised $700,000 for Refugees International. She is a natural teacher and storyteller with an active mind that constantly searches for accurate truth.</p> <p>I highly recommend Annie’s new book, Thinking in Bets, which comes out this week. In her life after poker, she is a featured speaker, writes a newsletter and a blog, and advises companies on improving their decision-making process. Have a look at her website, <a href= "../../../content/annieduke.com">annieduke.com</a>, for more information.</p> <p>Our conversation discusses Annie’s path from an Ivy League education to professional poker, the nature of a bet, how we form beliefs, why we make bad decisions, and what we can do to improve our decision-making process.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Joel Wittenberg is the chief investment officer and vice president of W.K. Kellogg Foundation, where he has managed the foundation's $8 billion in assets since 2009. The Kellogg Foundation is guided by the belief that all children should have an equal opportunity to thrive. In accordance with that mission, in 2007 its Board committed to be an effective anti-racist organization that promotes racial equity. Over the ensuing thirteen years, the organization has become a leader in applying research and taking effective action.</p> <p>Our conversation touches on Joel’s background in the fixed income markets and the application of duration and convexity to allocating capital.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joel Wittenberg is the chief investment officer and vice president of W.K. Kellogg Foundation, where he has managed the foundation's $8 billion in assets since 2009. The Kellogg Foundation is guided by the belief that all children should have an equal opportunity to thrive. In accordance with that mission, in 2007 its Board committed to be an effective anti-racist organization that promotes racial equity. Over the ensuing thirteen years, the organization has become a leader in applying research and taking effective action.</p> <p>Our conversation touches on Joel’s background in the fixed income markets and the application of duration and convexity to allocating capital.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Randall Stutman is founder and co-head of the Leadership Practice at CRA. and the Admired Leadership Institute. Randall is probably the top executive coach that you’ve never heard of before. He’s spent 30 years coaching and learning about the behaviors and routines of extraordinary leaders. To give you a sense, he was worked in the White House and the Olympics, with something like 2,000 senior executives and 400 CEOs, and in our world, the most senior executives at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Blackstone. Randall is also well known among the titans in the hedge fund community, where he’s worked with many of the industry’s leading funds. And he’s done all of this entirely by word of mouth referral.<br /> <br /> Randall was one of the first people I asked to come on the show three years ago, and he respectfully declined – at that point in time not wanting share the uncovered behaviors that drive his work. A few months ago, he and his partners launched Admired Leadership, an online course with short videos of 100 behaviors repeated by the most talented CEOs. The course is extraordinary. It’s so ridiculously good that I started sharing a link to it in my email signature as a gift to those who don’t know about it.<br /> <br /> Our conversation covers Randall’s path to coaching and the coaching process. We cover behaviors common among hedge fund managers, the admired leadership course, and examples across inspiring others, decision making, time management, and elevating performance. We close with Randall’s thoughts on behaviors that allocators can identify in their manager research.</p> <p><strong><u>Learn More</u></strong><br /> Read the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/premium">Transcript</a><br /> Subscribe to the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Capital Allocators Blog or Monthly Mailing List</a><br /> Don't Subscribe, but <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Let Us Know Who You Are</a><br /> Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a><br />  Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a><br /> Review past episodes of the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">Podcast</a><br /> <br /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Richard Lawrence is the Chairman and Executive Director of The Overlook Group, a $5 billion investment organization focused on Asian equities that Richard founded in 1991. Over the past quarter-century, Overlook developed and implemented disciplined investment and business philosophies that interconnected to drive extraordinary results for its partners. Overlook has compounded capital at an annualized 14.5%, outperforming its benchmark by an insane 9% per annum. But that’s not all, as Richard would proudly tell you himself, the capital weighted return of the average investor in Overlook is nearly identical to the time weighted return over any period of time – a rare feat in the money management industry. Indeed, today’s asset base is the result of $4 billion of investment gains on top of $1 billion in contributed capital.<br /> <br /> Our conversation starts with a look at investing in Asia in Overlook’s early days and walks through the particulars of the approach Richard takes to investing and running his business, including attractive investment attributes, management integrity, portfolio construction, selling discipline, and China Yangtze Power - the only stock the firm supersized in an SPV in its history. We discuss Overlook’s long-held cap on subscriptions and periodic reductions in its management fee, two business philosophies that Richard believes have been key drivers of Overlook’s success.<br /> If you enjoyed my conversation with Tom Russo, you won’t want to miss this one with Richard.</p> <p><strong><u>Learn More</u></strong><br /> Read the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/premium">Transcript</a><br /> Subscribe to the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Capital Allocators Blog or Monthly Mailing List</a><br /> Don't Subscribe, but <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Let Us Know Who You Are</a><br /> Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a><br />  Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a><br /> Review past episodes of the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">Podcast</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Rabil is the co-founder and CEO of the Premier Lacrosse League or PLL, a new tour-based league of the top professional lacrosse players in the world that will debut on June 1st.  Paul was the #1 player in the draft for Major League Lacrosse in 2008 after winning a national championship at Johns Hopkins.  He is a 7-time Champion and 3-time MVP.  Alongside his on-the-field accomplishments, Paul is a passionate entrepreneur who was the first lacrosse player to earn $1 million in endorsements.</p> <p>Our conversation covers Paul’s early interest in lacrosse, developing a social media fan following, the importance of sponsorship revenue for athletes, and the leverage athletes have over teams.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After getting some great feedback from the replay of my conversation with Scott Malpass, I am going to repeat some gems from the past every few months. This week I picked out my conversation with Andy Golden, the venerable head of Princeton’s 24 billion dollar endowment. It’s another master class in endowment management from a seasoned veteran.</p> <p>Andy Golden is the President of Princeton University’s Investment Management Company (PRINCO). Having grown from $3B at the time of his arrival in 1995 to $22.5B today, PRINCO has been among the highest performing endowments in the world.

This week I picked out my conversation with Andy Golden, the venerable head of Princeton’s 24 billion dollar endowment. It’s another master class in endowment management from a seasoned veteran.</p> <p>Andy Golden is the President of Princeton University’s Investment Management Company (PRINCO). Having grown from $3B at the time of his arrival in 1995 to $22.5B today, PRINCO has been among the highest performing endowments in the world. Andy came to PRINCO from Duke Management Company, where he was an Investment Director, and received his formative training in the business working for David Swensen at the Yale University Investments Office.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kip McDaniel is the Chief Content Officer and Editorial Director at Institutional Investor.  Prior to joining II a year ago, Kip spent seven years as the Founding Editor and Editor-in-Chief of CIO Magazine, a media platform that led him to interview 2,000 Chief Investment Officers across every type of asset base around the world. Kip is a graduate of Harvard College, received a Master’s at Cambridge University, and was an elite crew rower, culminating in bringing home bronze medals for Team Canada in two World Championships.</p> <p>Kip is inordinately well-liked in the community, and I had a hunch I would learn a lot from getting his perspective on the people who make capital allocation happen. Suffice it to say, I wasn’t disappointed.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with an inside look at Chief Investment Officers – how Kip finds them, ranks them, and discovers what makes them tick. Over the back half of the discussion, we turn to the lessons he’s learned about investment success, incentives, fads, and issues that permeate capital allocation. Kip’s modus operandi is story-telling, and this conversation is chock full of good ones.</p> <p><strong><u>Learn More</u></strong><br /> Read the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/premium">Transcript</a><br /> Subscribe to the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Capital Allocators Blog or Monthly Mailing List</a><br /> Don't Subscribe, but <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/contact">Let Us Know Who You Are</a><br /> Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a><br />  Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a><br /> Review past episodes of the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">Podcast</a><br /> <br /> <br /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="auto">Dawn Fitzpatrick is the Chief Investment Officer at Soros Fund Management, where she manages $25 billion in Soros family and philanthropic assets. Dawn started her career as a trader at O’Connor and went on to serve as the global head and CIO of O’Connor. In 2016, UBS Asset Management promoted her to Global Head of Equities, Multi-Asset and O’Connor, where she oversaw more than $500 billion in assets.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Sonkin and Paul Johnson are investors, professors, and co-authors of <em>Pitch the Perfect Investment</em>.  Paul Sonkin is an analyst and portfolio manager at GAMCO Investors and has researched small, micro, and nanocap companies for a quarter century. He taught for 16 years at Columbia Business School. Paul Johnson runs advisory firm Nicusa Investment Advisors, and previously was a top-ranked sell side analyst, hedge fund manager, and an investment banker across 35 years.  He also taught 2,000 students across 40 classes at Columbia Business School and Fordham University, and has received a host of awards for his prowess in the classroom.</p> <p>Their recently released book is the first I’ve come across that reverse engineers a portfolio manager’s thought process. It starts with crystal clear first principles of business analysis and covers everything an analyst needs to know to identify a great stock. Then, Paul and Paul describe how portfolio managers assess ideas. Their framework is targeted for analysts starting their careers in the field, but seasoned portfolio managers and allocators both will also learn a lot about communication with their teams from the clear descriptions and colorful examples in the book.</p> <p>Our conversation covers the concept of the book, the wisdom of crowds, getting an ‘edge’, the four questions every portfolio manager needs to answer, and the role of creativity in investing. These gifted professors offer clear terminology for investment first principals and along the way offer a renewed appreciation for how difficult it is to beat the markets.</p> <p>For more episodes, go to <a href= "../../../content/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast</a></p> <p>Follow Ted on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tseides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tseides</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My guest on today’s First Meeting is Richard Lawrence of Overlook Investments Group, one of the top managers of Asian equities.  The conversation that follows is a replay of an early episode on Capital Allocators and one of the inspirations for the First Meeting concept. </p> <p>Richard Lawrence is the Chairman and Executive Director of The Overlook Group, a $5 billion investment organization focused on Asian equities that Richard founded in 1991. Over the past quarter-century, Overlook developed and implemented disciplined investment and business philosophies that interconnected to drive extraordinary results for its partners. Overlook has compounded capital at an annualized 14.5%, outperforming its benchmark by an insane 9% per annum. But that’s not all, as Richard would proudly tell you himself, the capital weighted return of the average investor in Overlook is nearly identical to the time weighted return over any period of time – a rare feat in the money management industry. Indeed, today’s asset base is the result of $4 billion of investment gains on top of $1 billion in contributed capital.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with a look at investing in Asia in Overlook’s early days and walks through the particulars of the approach Richard takes to investing and running his business, including attractive investment attributes, management integrity, portfolio construction, selling discipline, and China Yangtze Power - the only stock the firm supersized in an SPV in its history.

Those familiar with his voice will already know how wide his curious mind travels, but I image far fewer know much about his daily investing activities.</p> <p>Our conversation begins with Patrick’s early start in the business and discovered passion for research. We turn to investing at OSAM, covering four core quantitative factors, how those factors work, the research process to dive deeper into each factor and explore new ones, machine learning, differentiated portfolio construction, and the impact of quants on the market.  We then turn to Patrick’s experience as a podcaster, discussing his conceptual learning loop, lessons from interviewing, and the ways he has applied lessons from the podcast to OSAM’s asset management business. We close by discussing investing in external managers, including a great nugget on probing quantitative strategies.</p> <p>Patrick and I both finished this conversation feeling that we had just scratched the surface, which might be fodder for a Part B down the road.  Regardless, I’m indebted to Patrick for being the catalyst behind the creation of Capital Allocators two years ago, and it was my great pleasure to get him on the other side of the microphone.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style= "font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><strong><u><span style="color: #333333;">Learn More</span></u></strong></span></span><br /> <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/transcripts"><span style= "font-family: Georgia;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style= "color: #333333;">Discuss show and Read the Transcript</span></span></span></a><br /> <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/"><u>CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</u></a></span></span></span><br />  <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Join the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/forum"><u>Capital Allocators Forum</u></a></span></span></span><br /> <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016"> <u>iTunes</u></a></span></span></span><br /> <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a></span></span></span><br />  <span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style= "font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #333333;">For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast"><u>CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</u></a></span></span></span></span></p>]]></description>

In his 30s he left the industry to explore what would come next. His path led to creating the RadReads blog and coaching about facing fears and insecurities attached to the relationship of psychology and money.

Enlisting at age 17, Bull drove tanks and was an honor graduate from Officer Candidate School while attending Syracuse University. Upon graduation from college, he accepted a commission as a Marine 2nd Lieutenant. Over the subsequent eleven years, Bull served as a combat Infantry Officer, leading Marines in the jungles of Panama, the deserts of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and on the fence-line at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He left active duty to earn his MBA at Harvard in 2000, where he was Co-President of his class.</p> <p>Bull started a business career after graduate school; however, when the U.S. was attacked on 9/11, Bull voluntarily returned to active duty. He saw combat action in Afghanistan and Iraq, and served as a Congressional Liaison for the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and the Special Operations Command.</p> <p>With a daughter on the way and 25 years of service under his belt, Bull retired as a Lieutenant Colonel. Since then, he has applied his leadership and management experience to the business world, focusing on organizational design and business development. His leadership training program, entitled WHOOPASS, has positively impacted start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike.</p> <p>Oh, and he took a break from that in 2016 to run for U.S. Congress.</p> <p>Our conversation discusses principles of leadership, management, and resource allocation, alongside colorful stories of success and failure.

The weeklong journey in the mountains of West Virginia provides a setting and platform for each participant to access their best self.</p> <p>Michael Mervosh is the deeply insightful Executive Director of the Hero’s Journey Foundation, an organization he created that provides experiential learning opportunities for human development and transformation based on Joseph Campbell’s mythic hero’s journey. He has a passion and indescribable skill in enlivening the developmental process and fostering vitality, meaning and well-being in individuals, groups, and organizations. When not running programs or training others, Michael practices psychotherapy at the Nuin Center in Pittsburgh, where he has professionally resided for 25 years.</p> <p>Our conversation took place in the mountains towards the end of this year’s journey and is quite different from those you may be accustomed to hearing on the show. We cover Michael’s path to creating the experience, the myth of the Hero, lessons in how the world actually works, the call to adventure, perfectionism, uncertainty, fear, and poetry.</p> <p>If you’re intrigued, I strongly encourage you to check out <a href= "http://herosjourneyfoundation.org">herosjourneyfoundation.org</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dan Ariely is a renowned behavioral economist, author, entrepreneur, and investor.  He is the James B.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Manny Friedman is the founder of EJF Capital.  Manny discussed his background and his nuanced take on markets last July in Episode 61 of the podcast.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Russo is the Managing Member of Gardner Russo & Gardner, where he manages $11 billion in a long only, global value strategy. Tom buys the stock of global consumer businesses with great brands and holds them for a really long time. He looks for businesses with a capacity to reinvest free cash flow and a capacity to suffer through short-term pain in order to achieve long-term gain. Tom started his investment career at the Sequoia Fund in New York, where he worked from 1984 to 1988.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Baumgartner is the CIO of the Institute for Advanced Study, where he oversees a $1 billion portfolio that seeks to achieve just median returns but with significantly less risk.  Prior to joining IAS, Mark had stints at the Ford Foundation overseeing risk, at Morgan Stanley’s Alternative Investment Partners, at both quantitative and qualitative hedge funds, and as a management consultant.  Oh, and he studied to be a rocket scientist before that.<br />  <br /> Our conversation covers Mark’s path to IAS and the principles of luck, risk, and uncertainty on that path. We discuss the IAS portfolio, one catered to achieve a low risk profile, and how he has stayed the course when that structure hasn’t been rewarded by markets.  We talk about identifying managers that fit into his approach and different metrics of defining risk at both the manager and portfolio levels.</p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: #262626;"> <span style="font-kerning: none;"><u><strong>Learn More</strong></u></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: #6b006d;"> <span style="font-kerning: none;"><a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/transcripts"><u>Discuss show and Read the Transcript</u></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: #6b006d;"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #262626;"> Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/"><span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #6b006d;"><u>CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</u></span></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: #6b006d;"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #262626;"> Join the <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/forum"><span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #6b006d;"> <u>Capital Allocators Forum</u></span></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: #262626;"> <span style="font-kerning: none;">Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #6b006d;"> <u>iTunes</u></span></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: #262626;"> <span style="font-kerning: none;">Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://twitter.com/tseides"><span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #6b006d;"> <u>@tseides</u></span></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 12.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: #6b006d;"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #262626; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #262626;"> For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast"><span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #6b006d; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #6b006d;"><u>CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</u></span></a></span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Solomon is the President of publicly listed Cowen Group (TK: COWN), a financial services company focused on supporting and providing active management to the marketplace. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, Jeff deferred an acting career with a brief respite on Wall Street, but he hasn’t looked back since. In 1994, he joined Peter Cohen, then the former head of investment bank Shearson Lehman Brothers, to form money management firm Ramius Advisors. Ramius grew to become one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and in 2009 merged with boutique investment bank Cowen Group.</p> <p>Following the merger, Jeff switched over to the investment bank side of the business and today serves as its Chief Executive Officer, where he embodies the firm’s core values of vision, tenacity and empathy.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with a passionate description of Pittsburgh sports, and flows to how active managers succeed in the 1990s and need to evolve to succeed today.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Solomon is the President of publicly listed Cowen Group (TK: COWN), a financial services company focused on supporting and providing active management to the marketplace. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, Jeff deferred an acting career with a brief respite on Wall Street, but he hasn’t looked back since. In 1994, he joined Peter Cohen, then the former head of investment bank Shearson Lehman Brothers, to form money management firm Ramius Advisors. Ramius grew to become one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and in 2009 merged with boutique investment bank Cowen Group.</p> <p>Following the merger, Jeff switched over to the investment bank side of the business and today serves as its Chief Executive Officer, where he embodies the firm’s core values of vision, tenacity and empathy.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with a passionate description of Pittsburgh sports, and flows to how active managers succeed in the 1990s and need to evolve to succeed today. We discuss the importance of empathy in the investment business, and touch on how Jeff’s summer camp experience as a kid informs how he manages people today. His answers to my closing questions are just amazing. If you’re short on time, fast forward to the 51stminute of the show.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After getting some great feedback from the replay of my conversation with Scott Malpass, I am going to repeat some gems from the past every few months. This week I picked out my conversation with Andy Golden, the venerable head of Princeton’s 24 billion dollar endowment. It’s another master class in endowment management from a seasoned veteran.</p> <p>Andy Golden is the President of Princeton University’s Investment Management Company (PRINCO). Having grown from $3B at the time of his arrival in 1995 to $22.5B today, PRINCO has been among the highest performing endowments in the world. Andy came to PRINCO from Duke Management Company, where he was an Investment Director, and received his formative training in the business working for David Swensen at the Yale University Investments Office. Andy currently serves on the fund Advisory Boards of several well-known private equity and venture capital managers, including Bain Capital, General Catalyst Partners, and Greylock Partners. He was a founding member of the Investors’ Committee of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets and serves as a Trustee of the Princeton Area Community Foundation and Rutgers Preparatory School. Andy holds a B.A. in Philosophy from Duke University and an M.P.P.M. from the Yale School of Management.</p> <p>Our conversation discusses Princeton’s endowment two decades ago and today, including its strategic advantages as an institution, shifts in thinking about asset allocation, decision making, team development, and partnership with managers. Andy’s long tenure in his seat, insight, and wisdom provides a treasure trove of information about how a top endowment manager practices his craft, and his subtle wit always keeps things light.</p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: #0000ee;"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #000000;"> Learn more at <a href= "http://www.peterattiamd.com/"><span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #0000ee;"><u>www.PeterAttiaMD.com</u></span></a></span></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000;"> <span style="font-kerning: none;">Connect with Peter on <a href= "applewebdata://DBEFC293-FD98-4EB3-A166-19C64D7FEC04/Facebook.com/PeterAttiaMD"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #0000ee;"> <u>Facebook</u></span></a> | <a href= "applewebdata://DBEFC293-FD98-4EB3-A166-19C64D7FEC04/Twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #0000ee;"> <u>Twitter</u></span></a> | <a href= "applewebdata://DBEFC293-FD98-4EB3-A166-19C64D7FEC04/Instagram.com/PeterAttiaMD"> <span style= "font-kerning: none; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: 0px #0000ee;"> <u>Instagram</u></span></a>.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kristian Fok is the Chief Investment Officer of Australia’s A46B ($35B USD) Construction & Building Industry Superannuation Fund, or CBUS.

Baseball may even be ahead of the data revolution in investing, and the story of the Astros could hint at lessons that money managers will need to apply going forward. </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: #0000ee;"> <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/premium">Discuss the show and Read the transcript</a></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 14.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: #0000ee;">  Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</a></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 14.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000;"> Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 14.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000;"> Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a></p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000; min-height: 14.0px;">  </p> <p style= "margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-stroke: #0000ee;">  For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The name Anthony Scaramucci currently has 55% name recognition in the U.S. according to Politico. Anthony has been an entrepreneur in the hedge fund industry for 23 years, growing to prominence within the industry through his oversight of fund of funds Skybridge Capital, creation of the popular SALT conference, regular television appearances, and rejuvenation of the iconic television show Wall Street Week.  He grew to prominence worldwide when his longtime political interests led to a brief tenure as White House Communications Director in 2017.</p> <p>Our conversation starts off with a bang and turns to the ups and downs in Anthony’s career, including getting fired and rehired at Goldman Sachs, starting and selling his first hedge fund, creating Skybridge and watching it almost fail, and thriving after the financial crisis. We discuss Anthony's thoughts on hedge funds, lessons from his stint in Washington, and books he has written about his experiences. Along the way, he shares life lessons about managing people, building relationships, resiliency, laughing at yourself, greed, ego, and fame.</p> <p>Anyone who has only known Anthony from his recent public profile might be surprised to hear the depth of his insight, self-effacing honesty and caring of others, alongside his irrepressible salesmanship.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Cembalest is the Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, a global industry leader with $2 trillion of client assets under management. Michael is also a member of the Investment Committee for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management and the Investment Committee for the J.P. Morgan Retirement Plan that covers the firm’s 250,000 employees. Before taking on his current seat in 2012, he spent eight years as Chief Investment Officer of J.P. Morgan’s powerhouse Global Private Bank. Prior to his work on the buy side, Michael worked on the sell side at J.P. Morgan Securities as head strategist for Emerging Markets Fixed Income. He started his thirty-year tenure at the firm as a member of the Corporate Finance division.</p> <p>Our wide-ranging conversation begins with Michael’s early career that included watching a financial crisis unfold in the late '80s and side-stepping another in the late '90s, and turns to his role as CIO of a large, global private bank.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Cembalest is the Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, a global industry leader with $2 trillion of client assets under management. Michael is also a member of the Investment Committee for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management and the Investment Committee for the J.P. Morgan Retirement Plan that covers the firm’s 250,000 employees. Before taking on his current seat in 2012, he spent eight years as Chief Investment Officer of J.P. Morgan’s powerhouse Global Private Bank. Prior to his work on the buy side, Michael worked on the sell side at J.P. Morgan Securities as head strategist for Emerging Markets Fixed Income. He started his thirty-year tenure at the firm as a member of the Corporate Finance division.</p> <p>Our wide-ranging conversation begins with Michael’s early career that included watching a financial crisis unfold in the late '80s and side-stepping another in the late '90s, and turns to his role as CIO of a large, global private bank. We discuss differences in asset allocation and implementation between private clients and institutions and along the way come across his evaluation of Bernie Madoff, the creation of his strategy piece - Eye on the Market, the chart that everyone hates, the impact of politics, government debt, and energy on the markets, and views about active management.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chris Brockmeyer is the Director of Employee Bennefit Funds for the Broadway League, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry.  Chris serves as an employer-appointed trustee, in most cases as Co-Chair, on eleven multi-employer pension funds, seven health funds and four annuity/401(k) funds with approximately $7 billion in assets. For 11 years, Chris has artfully navigated delicate relationships across unions and employers and was honored for his great work by Institutional Investor magazine with the 2014 award for Taft-Hartley Plan of the Year.  Before arriving at the Broadway League in 2007, Chris worked on both sides of the table – first representing employees in eight years of work for performer’s unions and then seven years representing employers as Director of Labor Relations at Live Nation/Clear Channel Entertainment.</p> <p>Our conversation dives into the tricky governance dynamics of Taft-Hartley boards, including their challenging regulatory structure, keeping the peace among constituents, setting investment objectives, strengths and weaknesses of a slow-moving decision-making body, best and worst in relationships with investment consultants, and OCIOs as a governance solution. Those struggling with governance challenges will take a step back and admire Chris’ dexterity in working productively with an ostensibly untenable set of circumstances.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Learn More</strong></p> <p>Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</a></p> <p>Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a></p> <p>Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a></p> <p>For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p> <p>2:08 – Chris’s background and how that led him to a job on Broadway.</p> <p>4:59 – Key skills that make Chris effective at his job</p> <p>5:44 – Current role at the Broadway League</p> <p>7:10 – What makes an effective board and a less effective board</p> <p>10:25 -  How do Chris and these various boards set out the investment objectives.</p> <p>12:41 – What needs to change in Taft-Hartley plans</p> <p>16:48 – The regulation of the Taft-Hartley Plan Boards</p> <p>20:25 – Strengths and weaknesses of the consulting relationships</p> <p>24:20 – How do discussions about increasing benefits translate into investment risk</p> <p>27:17 – How wide is the range of asset allocation across all of the plans</p> <p>29:05 – How do you explain expected rate of return assumptions in the current environment</p> <p>31:15 – What are the strengths that Chris has seen in successful investment consultants</p> <p>32:40 – Chris’s core investing beliefs and how much he can influence these boards with them</p> <p>35:31 – Are there places where the governance of Taft-Hartley plans could be improved</p> <p>39:31 – Switching to OCIOs</p> <p>41:32 – Would they ever go back to a regular consultant from an OCIO</p> <p>42:59 – Other areas that have similar governance struggles</p> <p>45:06 – What happens when Chris comes up with an investment idea</p> <p>46:30 – Any concern that Chris’s team is working with only average OCIO’s or consultants as they look to scale up and attract larger funds</p> <p> </p> <p>48:59 – Closing Questions</p>]]></description>

He has an irrepressibly creative mind and, alongside his partners, writes one of my favorite manager letters. </p> <p>Our conversation covers Andy's nuanced view of the evolution of trading markets and financial instruments over his forty-year career, including arbitrage trading in the 1970s and 80s, unintended consequences of the deregulation of trading commissions, segmentation of market participants, importance of liability management, growth of orphaned securities, and the pending shift from decentralized to centralized market systems over the coming years.</p> <p> </p> <p>Learn More</p> <p>Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</a></p> <p>Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a></p> <p>Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a></p> <p>For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Show Notes</p> <p>1:52 – Andy’s background and the founding of Whitebox</p> <p>5:34 – The math of options in the late 70’s, early 80s </p> <p>13:44 - The decentralization of markets</p> <p>16:34 -  Andy’s transition into trading other strategies</p> <p>18:31 – The launch of Whitebox</p> <p>20:08 – The meaning of the firm name Whitebox</p> <p>23:38 – An example of a transitioning security from one group of investors to another</p> <p>28:31 – Has it gotten harder to find arbitrage opportunities</p> <p>32:29 – The driver of the financial crisis</p> <p>32:44 – <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Misunderstanding-Financial-Crises-Dont-Coming/dp/019992290X/ref=la_B00357E21I_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1522242744&sr=1-1"> Gary Gorton, Misunderstanding Financial Crises: Why Don't We See Them Coming</a></p> <p>34:28 – His purchase of a bank</p> <p>38:17 – How he got involved in the structured credit markets</p> <p>42:39 – What is that Whitebox does differently from others</p> <p>47:14 – Principles that guide the investment activities he likes to take part in</p> <p>50:03 – How will the financial system evolve over the next 10 years</p> <p>55:29 – Closing questions</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our exploration of the use of modern data analytics to enhance investment results continues this week with two of the leading providers of tools for portfolio managers. </p> <p>My guests on today’s show are Clare Flynn Levy and Cameron Hight, both former investment managers who became entrepreneurs seeking to improve outcomes for other managers. Clare is the founder and CEO of Essentia Analytics, a behavioral data analytics service that enables fund managers to capture rich data about their own behavior and its context. Essentia analyzes trading history to help managers overcome common behavioral biases and optimize their trade entry and exit on positions. </p> <p>Cameron is the Founder and CEO of Alpha Theory, a fintech company that helps investment managers optimize their position sizing process.  By creating a disciplined, real-time process based on a decision algorithm with roots in actuarial science, physics, and poker, Alpha Theory takes the guessing out of position sizing and allows managers to focus on what they do best - picking stocks. </p> <p>Our conversations cover the founding of their respective businesses, the mistakes portfolio managers commonly make, the tools they employ to help managers improve, and the challenges they face in broader adoption of these modern tools.  The good news is the clients of Essentia and Alpha Theory have demonstrated improvement in their results after employing these techniques.  If you ask Clare and Cameron, you may come a whole new appreciation about the potential for active management going forward. </p> <p>You can learn more about these two innovative companies at essentia-analytics.com and alphatheory.com.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Learn More</strong></p> <p>Join Ted's mailing list at <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com</a></p> <p>Write a review on <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/capital-allocators-with-ted-seides/id1223764016">iTunes</a></p> <p>Follow Ted on twitter at <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/tseides">@tseides</a></p> <p>For more episodes go to <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast">CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com/Podcast</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p> <p><strong>Clare (2:26)</strong></p> <p>2:29 – Clare’s path to founding Essentia </p> <p>5:42 – What makes data science of investing revolutionary in the past five years </p> <p>6:25 – The pitch for Essentia’s tools </p> <p>7:57 – How do you use data to get into the behaviors that work and the ones that don’t</p> <p>             8:06 – <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/2018/01/08/mauboussin/">Michael Mauboussin podcast episode</a></p> <p>             8:10 – <a href= "http://capitalallocatorspodcast.com/2018/02/05/annied/">Annie Duke podcast episode</a> </p> <p>11:03 – Specific tenants of behavioral finance </p> <p>12:39 – Parts of the portfolio process that they explore </p> <p>14:20 – How do you actually convince people to change behavior </p> <p>16:17 – The nudges built into the system </p> <p>21:26 – How much data is needed to be able to help improve performance </p> <p>22:16 – Most interesting data set that a portfolio manager has tried to get to improve their performance </p> <p>24:21 – Is there consistency in people’s patterns </p> <p>27:08 -  The hardest part of convincing someone to become a client </p> <p>29:16 – What other places does Essentia plan on expanding </p> <p>30:42 – Given all of the data that Clare has seen, what’s her outlook on active management</p> <p>32:39 - Closing questions for Clare </p> <p><strong>Cameron (37:58)</strong></p> <p>38:02 – Cameron’s background and the founding of Alpha Theory </p> <p>38:35 – What problems does Alpha Theory looks to solve</p> <p>             38:49 – Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (Richard Shure) </p> <p>40:13 – The mistakes he sees portfolio managers make </p> <p>42:29 – What tool does Alpha theory is provide to portfolio managers </p> <p>44:17 – What changes in the portfolio manager’s implementation </p> <p>47:27 – What have been the outcomes when people implement Alpha Theory </p> <p>51:58 -  Are there different firms or type of firms that are better at picking stocks </p> <p>56:36 - <a href= "http://blog.alphatheory.com/2017/05/changing-the-course-of-active-management-the-concentration-manifesto.html"> The Concentration Manifesto</a> </p> <p>1:00:25 – How they calculate batting average of allocators</p> <p>1:01:41 – Where else could this tool be applied</p> <p>1:03:31 – What questions should allocators be asking of managers</p> <p>1:05:09 – How much does the input of information impact the outcome</p> <p>1:06:42 – What other research has Cameron been able to do based on this data</p> <p>1:08:56 – Biggest challenge in running this business</p> <p> </p> <p>1:11:23 – Closing questions for Cameron</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Annie Duke is a renown public speaker and decision strategist. For two decades, she was one of the top poker players in the world, including winning a World Series of Poker bracelet and the $2 million winner-take-all WSOP Tournament of Champions. Her study of the science of smart decision-making began with a National Science Foundation Fellowship, which she used study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.  Among her charity work and television appearances, Annie was a runner-up to Joan Rivers on Celebrity Apprentice, during which she raised $700,000 for Refugees International. She is a natural teacher and storyteller with an active mind that constantly searches for accurate truth.</p> <p>I highly recommend Annie’s new book, Thinking in Bets, which comes out this week. In her life after poker, she is a featured speaker, writes a newsletter and a blog, and advises companies on improving their decision-making process. Have a look at her website, <a href="annieduke.com">annieduke.com</a>, for more information.</p> <p>Our conversation discusses Annie’s path from an Ivy League education to professional poker, the nature of a bet, how we form beliefs, why we make bad decisions, and what we can do to improve our decision-making process.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Scott Malpass is the esteemed Vice President and CIO of Notre Dame, where he oversees the University’s $12 billion endowment. Scott earned his B.A. and M.B.A. degrees at Notre Dame, and returned to South Bend at the ripe age of 26 following a brief stint on Wall Street.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Richard Lawrence is the Chairman and Executive Director of The Overlook Group, a $5 billion investment organization focused on Asian equities that Richard founded in 1991. Over the past quarter-century, Overlook developed and implemented disciplined investment and business philosophies that interconnected to drive extraordinary results for its partners. Overlook has compounded capital at an annualized 14.5%, outperforming its benchmark by an insane 9% per annum. But that’s not all, as Richard would proudly tell you himself, the capital weighted return of the average investor in Overlook is nearly identical to the time weighted return over any period of time – a rare feat in the money management industry. Indeed, today’s asset base is the result of $4 billion of investment gains on top of $1 billion in contributed capital.<br /> <br /> Our conversation starts with a look at investing in Asia in Overlook’s early days and walks through the particulars of the approach Richard takes to investing and running his business, including attractive investment attributes, management integrity, portfolio construction, selling discipline, and China Yangtze Power - the only stock the firm supersized in an SPV in its history. We discuss Overlook’s long-held cap on subscriptions and periodic reductions in its management fee, two business philosophies that Richard believes have been key drivers of Overlook’s success.<br /> If you enjoyed my conversation with Tom Russo, you won’t want to miss this one with Richard.<br /> <br /> For more episodes, go to <a href= "../../../content/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast</a><br /> <br /> Follow Ted on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tseides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tseides</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Solomon is the President of publicly listed Cowen Group (TK: COWN), a financial services company focused on supporting and providing active management to the marketplace. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, Jeff deferred an acting career with a brief respite on Wall Street, but he hasn’t looked back since. In 1994, he joined Peter Cohen, then the former head of investment bank Shearson Lehman Brothers, to form money management firm Ramius Advisors. Ramius grew to become one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and in 2009 merged with boutique investment bank Cowen Group.</p> <p>Following the merger, Jeff switched over to the investment bank side of the business and today serves as its Chief Executive Officer, where he embodies the firm’s core values of vision, tenacity and empathy.</p> <p>Our conversation starts with a passionate description of Pittsburgh sports, and flows to how active managers succeed in the 1990s and need to evolve to succeed today. We discuss the importance of empathy in the investment business, and touch on how Jeff’s summer camp experience as a kid informs how he manages people today.  His answers to my closing questions are just amazing. If you’re short on time, fast forward to the 51stminute of the show.  You’ll miss plenty along the way, but you don’t want to miss these.</p> <p>Please enjoy my conversation with Jeff Solomon.</p> <p> </p> <p>For more episodes, go to <a href= "../../../content/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast</a><br /> <br /> Follow Ted on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tseides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tseides</a></p>]]></description>

We discuss the importance of empathy in the investment business, and touch on how Jeff’s summer camp experience as a kid informs how he manages people today.  His answers to my closing questions are just amazing. If you’re short on time, fast forward to the 51stminute of the show.  You’ll miss plenty along the way, but you don’t want to miss these.</p> <p>Please enjoy my conversation with Jeff Solomon.</p> <p> </p> <p>For more episodes, go to <a href= "../../../content/capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast" target= "_blank" rel= "noopener">capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast</a>  Follow Ted on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tseides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tseides</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Charley Ellis is one of the most highly regarded experts in the investment business.  After spending nearly a decade as an equity research analyst in the 1960s, Charley founded financial services consulting firm Greenwich Associates in 1972 to help institutions understand what their clients think of them.  Over 50 years, Charley has worked hand in hand with nearly every major financial institution in the world and has published sixteen books on investing, including his most recent “The Index Revolution: Why Investors Should Join It Now.”</p> <p>Charley is not just another preacher for index fund investing.

Charley describes elegantly why indexing is a winner’s game for many, and then walks through very special and rare qualities of three of the most successful active managers over the last few decades – Vanguard, Capital Group, and Yale University.</p> <p>Charley is a brilliant communicator and masterful storyteller.

Just about everyone in the investment profession with Harvard Business School on their resume took a seat in his classroom at one point in time. André received numerous awards for teaching excellence, including being voted the School’s most outstanding professor in a Business Week student survey.<br /> <br /> While at Harvard, André authored and co-authored 27 articles in financial journals, two books, and over 100 case studies, all relating to investment management, capital markets, and the financial system. He literally chronicled the development of modern finance as it occurred through is work at HBS.<br /> <br /> Among his directorships and trustee roles over the years, André currently is a Board member at The Vanguard Group.<br /> <br /> In this episode, we spend the first 11:30 talking about teaching at Harvard, and then turn to the practice of investing: the active vs. passive debate, a risk-based approach to asset allocation, and what makes investing so hard.  I found it fascinating hearing how André takes all of his academic experience and knowledge and applies it the practice of investing at HighVista. His wisdom and clarity of thought are second to none, and his soothing South African accent only adds to the allure.<br /> <br /> For more episodes, go to capitalallocatorspodcast.com/podcast<br /> <br /> Follow Ted on twitter at @tseides</p>]]></description>

André received numerous awards for teaching excellence, including being voted the School’s most outstanding professor in a Business Week student survey.  While at Harvard, André authored and co-authored 27 articles in financial journals, two books, and over 100 case studies, all relating to investment management, capital markets, and the financial system. He literally chronicled the development of modern finance as it occurred through is work at HBS.  Among his directorships and trustee roles over the years, André currently is a Board member at The Vanguard Group.  In this episode, we spend the first 11:30 talking about teaching at Harvard, and then turn to the practice of investing: the active vs. passive debate, a risk-based approach to asset allocation, and what makes investing so hard.  I found it fascinating hearing how André takes all of his academic experience and knowledge and applies it the practice of investing at HighVista. His wisdom and clarity of thought are second to none, and his soothing South African accent only adds to the allure.
